# WebKit Explainers

This repo is a place where WebKit contributors may post [explainers](https://github.com/w3ctag/w3ctag.github.io/blob/master/explainers.md) of pre-standardization web platform feature ideas, and a place where these explainers can be discussed, refined, and readied for migration to appropriate standards bodies (such as the [Privacy CG](https://github.com/privacycg/) or [WICG](https://github.com/WICG)).
