# WebKit Explainers

This repo is a place where WebKit contributors may post
[explainers](https://github.com/w3ctag/w3ctag.github.io/blob/master/explainers.md)
of pre-standardization web platform feature ideas, and a place where
these explainers can be discussed, refined, and readied for migration to
appropriate standards bodies (such as [WICG](https://github.com/WICG)).

## Explainers
